  bio: Almambet is a 2012 graduate student of Fox Valley and Central Wisconsin Sports Car Clubs (FVSCC and CWSCC). At these clubs he received his Bachelor's degree in Autocross through a high-intensity program lasting from April 2011-August 2012. His concentration included understanding the behavior of extreme front-wheel drive plow in a Honda Accord, and later a lighter chassis Acura RSX Type-S. Utilizing these chassis on a weekly basis, he learned to optimize between understeering characteristics and aggressiveness. This exact excercise developed a good basis of (low-mid speed) driving skills. 
  
At the end of the program, Almambet experienced the chassis performance of an s2k through an invitation. This very experience transformed his direction to develop skills to drive a rear-wheel drive chassis and persue a graduate-level degree, specializing in performance driving s2ks. This post is about observations of this venture...
