Microstructure pattern in alloy metals is highly dependent on processing of the metal. Slight processing variation of a
metal alloy can yield entirely different microstructure patterns. Microstructure has a direct influence on material
properties, and therefore it is crucial to know how process affects the materialâ€™s properties. In the material Process-
Structure-Property (PSP) linkage, this project will focus on the Process-Structure correlation of silver-aluminum-copper
ternary eutectic alloy microstructure patterns during phase solidification. A dataset of 2-dimensional microstructures
obtained from a phase-field model will be used to correlate different process parameters with intermediate and final
microstructures. The three final phases of the ternary eutectic alloy are Al, Al<sub>2</sub>Cu, and Ag<sub>2</sub>Al. A statistical definition of
microstructure will be created using spatial 2-point statistics to quantify the microstructure. Furthermore, a reduced-
order of microstructure patterns will be represented using Principles Component Analysis (PCA), which will be used to
track the effect of processing parameters on microstructure patterns. Then, process-structure linkages will be built using
machine learning techniques to create a model used to predict possible microstructure patterns based on process
parameters.
